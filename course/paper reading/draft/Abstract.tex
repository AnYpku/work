Penning trap has high accuracy in measuring ion physical properties including the particle magnetic moment. With the help of the device, we can measure magnetic moment of the ${}^{7}Li$ ion because of its stability not decaying under natural circumstances, and obtain a much better result in a high precision. It is a breakthrough to use the double Penning trap, in one of which a sigle ${}^{7}Li$ ion was driven,and in the other of which the specific measurement and analysis were done. There is a two orders of magnitude or more improvement measuring the  magnetic moment of ${}^{7}Li$ using the double Penning trap.
