 2 Fixed order (no event generation and no MC@[N]LO matching):    fixed_order=OFF
 3 Shower the generated events:                                        shower=ON
 4 Decay particles with the MadSpin module:                           madspin=OFF
 5 Add weights to the events based on changing model parameters:     reweight=ON
 6 Run MadAnalysis5 on the events generated:                     madanalysis5=Not installed
  Either type the switch number (1 to 6) to change its default setting,
  or set any switch explicitly (e.g. type 'order=LO' at the prompt)
  Type '0', 'auto', 'done' or just press enter when you are done.
